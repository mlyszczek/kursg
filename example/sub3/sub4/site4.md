site 4
======

next couple of directories are empty (as in no files, only directories) so to
prevent rendering empty site (with nothing but menu) program will try to find
first valid file and will render page for that file.

When you now click on [sub5](./sub5.html) a few new menu levels will appear with
content from the "nearest" file in the path. You can try to click each sub to
see that still the same page is rendered.
