Matching file and directory
===========================

This file *sub1.md* matches directory *sub1*. Thus when opening this page that
is *sub1.html* you will see menu with files inside *sub1* but content will be
loaded from matched *sub1.html*. Going inside into
[subpage1.html](sub1/subpage1.html) you will see different content.

Check [sub2](./sub2.html) page to see, what would happen if there was no
matching page.
